								<h2>Previous Experience</h2>
								<p>Currently working at the Delaware Department of Technology & Information, under the Enterprise Desktop/LAN team. My team is responsible for maintaining ~10,000 devices on the network with life management, desktop solutions, and end user support. Currently stationed in the DTI Headquarters, supporting the entire state of Delaware and a few agency sites.</p>

								<h2>Future Goals</h2>
								<p>I will be continuing my education at Wilington University to earn my bachelors in Cybersecurity. My long term goal is to stay in the public sector, where I can continue to contribute to securing, and increasing reliability in technical environments. I take pride in government work, and enjoy knowing that the work I do impacts my community. I also plan on gaining more experience in cybersecurity by completing certifications in Security+ and CEH. Currently, I am studying Network+ and MD102 to round out my general IT knowledge in Enterprise environents. DTCC has played a critical role in my journey thus far, and I am exicted about what's ahead in my path.  </p>

		<h2>Interview Experience</h2>
		<p>During my temporary assignment on the Engineering Desktop/LAN (EDL) team, I was given the opportunity to interview for a permanent position. As part of the process, I created a PowerPoint highlighting the work I completed, including contributions to the CrowdStrike remediation project and overall team support. Instead of presenting it live, I shared the deck with the team for their review. This experience not only strengthened my communication skills but also reinforced my desire to continue working in the public sectorâ€”where my efforts directly support the state and its agencies.</p>
